description: Increase the use of silvopasture by increaasing the average sequestration
  factor associated with pastures. This transformer models silvopasture as a fraction
  of pastures with planted forests. Since the magnitude is a fraction of area, the
  average sequestration factor is estimated as m*f, where m is the magnitude (prevalence)
  and f is the secondary forest sequestration factor.
